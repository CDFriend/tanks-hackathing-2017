# Tanks Clone: Hackathing 2017
To brush up on some basic java game development, I decided to make a clone
of the Atari game "tanks" for Hackathing 2017. Writing the application, I 
initially set the character movement way too fast...it was so comically 
frustrating to play that I decided to keep it.

Play at your own risk. May result in broken friendships, sanities and/or computers.
